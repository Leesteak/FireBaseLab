# FireBaseLab
Lab 4 work

This includes the implementation of the ProductCatalog Application. Although the implementation is not fully correct, I hope the fact that I could not attend a lab due to the mondahy session being cancelled is taken into account. I think it is very close, but I was unable to find what was causing the error I was getting (and in fact I think it may have been related to the memory of my PC, as it was up to 100% memory while emulating)
